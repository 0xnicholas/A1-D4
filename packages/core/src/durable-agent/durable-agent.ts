 * The approval declaration lives here, never on `Tool` (`#13` keeps the core permission-free): a
 * call whose tool name is on the list does not execute — the run suspends instead, its loop
 * snapshot goes to the `AgentRunSnapshotStore`, and `finishReason` settles `'suspended'`. `resume`
 * loads the snapshot and continues the run: `approved: true` executes the held calls, `approved:
 * false` answers them with a user-rejected error result and lets the model replan — the run is not
 * terminated by a rejection. Suspension exists in this wrapper alone: a bare agent run never
 * produces `'suspended'` (`agent/loop.ts` keeps no snapshot and holds no approval state).
 *
 * Single-process semantics where it matters: the store's in-memory default keeps snapshots for this
 * process, and concurrent resumes of one run are deduplicated in process. The port is the
 * deployment surface — attaching a durable store and clearing a consumed snapshot are the
 * application's side (no CAS, no cross-process recovery).
