/**
 * The output object (CONTEXT.md 「输出对象」): the dual-consumable return of one execution —
 * `for await` walks its chunk stream, `await` reads its terminal values, both backed by a single
 * lazy pass over the run. The agent stream (`agent/stream.ts`) and the workflow run output
 * (`workflows/run.ts`) build theirs through `createOutputObject` — their sources differ only in
 * shape (the agent pulls an async generator, the workflow pushes events from a promise), which
 * the `start` callback parameterizes away; the harness wrappers observe one through
 * `teeOutputObject`, and `materialize` awaits the terminal record.
 *
 * Internal seam — not exported from any entry (the `standard-schema-runtime.ts` pattern). The
 * interface is shaped so it could be promoted to a public subpath as-is; that promotion needs its
 * own issue (explicit ratification) — this module changes no export surface.
 *
 * The pinned semantics (asserted through the public surface by the behavior contract,
 * `test/helpers/output-object-contract.ts`, running against both the agent and the workflows
 * suites):
 * - **Lazy start**: the source's `start` runs on first consumption — the first `next()` of the
 *   chunk stream or the first terminal read. A result nobody consumes never runs.
 * - **Single pass, single iterator**: one execution feeds both consumption styles; every
 *   `[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` call returns the same iterator.
 * - **Order and buffering**: chunks go to the waiting iterator, or buffer in stream order until
 *   one asks.
 * - **Failure after the buffer**: a failed run still delivers everything it produced; the error
 *   rejects the iterator only once the buffer has drained, and rejects every terminal promise
 *   with the same error.
 * - **Abandon stays local**: leaving the `for await` loop early ends that traversal (the buffer
 *   is dropped) but never the run — nothing propagates to the source, and the terminal values
 *   still settle from the same pass.
 * - **Lazy terminals**: a terminal promise is created when it is read (settling before the first
 *   read stores the outcome), so a run whose terminals nobody awaits cannot reject unhandled;
 *   reading twice returns the same promise.
 *
 * Load-bearing constraint for callers augmenting the returned object with extra fields: assign
 * them with `Object.assign`, never spread — reading a terminal property starts the run, and a
 * spread reads them all (laziness depends on it).
