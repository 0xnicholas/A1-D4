/**
 * The structured-output feature (execution semantics, run option
 * `structuredOutput: { schema }`): one schema does two jobs at the two ends of the run.
 *
 * - **Down**: the schema's JSON Schema (`~standard.jsonSchema`, the draft-07 target — the same
 *   conversion tool schemas go through) rides on **every** model call of the run as
 *   `responseFormat`, so the provider is told the shape to answer in.
 * - **Up**: the run's terminal text — the last step's authoritative record, processors' rewrites
 *   included — is parsed as JSON and validated, and the schema's value settles the run's `object`.
 *
 * Strict is the only strategy: an answer that is not JSON, or does not match the schema, fails the
 * run with `StructuredOutputError`. There is no `errorStrategy`, no repair round trip, no silent
 * fallback to raw text.

 * The run's terminal text is kept unparsed (`text`), so the caller can see what the model actually
 * answered; `issues` carries the schema's issues when the text was JSON but did not match, and is
